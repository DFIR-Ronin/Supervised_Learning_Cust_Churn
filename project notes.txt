After Data is transformed into binary (T/F) variables:

1) specified x and y

2) scale data and apply pca + dimmension reduction
3) create the Kfold Framework
4) split data after pca into k-folds
--> In python this creates a generator object.
5) for each k-fold, split test / train
--- Logistic Regression

5) create model for LogReg
6) get prediction variables on test data (derived from PCA, which is derived from x)
7) Calculate confusion matrix; specificity; prcision; FDR; FOR
8) plot ROC curve (LogReg model, x_test, y_test)
9) Print stats

--- Naive Bayes
10) create GaussianNB model
11) prediction variables
12) confusuion matrix; statistics
13) plot ROC curve (NB model, x_test, y_test)
14) 9) Print stats



Notes:
What are baseline probabilities? And how does that relate to kappa
